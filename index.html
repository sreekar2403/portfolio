									<h3>Machine Learning Engineer | Freshworks</h3>
									<p><em>Jan 2020 - Present</em></p>
									
									<p>I have had the opportunity to build my career at <strong>Freshworks</strong>, where I've been working for the past five years, starting as an intern and growing into a <strong>Machine Learning Engineer</strong>. Throughout this journey, I've contributed to several impactful projects that blend data science, machine learning, and backend engineering.</p>
									
									<ul>
										<li><strong>Internship & Pronoun Resolution Project (2020):</strong> I joined Freshworks as a data science intern, where my first major task was working on a <strong>pronoun resolution</strong> project. The goal was to identify and replace pronouns with their respective proper nouns in text, making the data more understandable for machine learning models. By solving this challenge, we enhanced the performance of downstream NLP models, improving their ability to comprehend context and improve their accuracy in delivering insights.</li>
										<li><strong>Machine Learning Engineer (Present Role):</strong> As I transitioned into a Machine Learning Engineer, I began working on more sophisticated projects that further harnessed the power of machine learning:
											<ul>
												<li><strong>Backend Development & QnA System:</strong> After converting to a full-time role, I worked on developing a <strong>QnA system</strong>, where my focus shifted towards backend development. I was responsible for designing and building a <strong>microservice architecture</strong>, ensuring the system's scalability and maintainability. I integrated and managed <strong>Elasticsearch/OpenSearch</strong> to handle complex queries efficiently. In addition, I implemented <strong>observability</strong> measures to ensure smooth performance monitoring and effective system maintenance.</li>
												<li><strong>Automation for Model Training and Deployment:</strong> I led the development of an automated service for model training and deployment using <strong>CI/CD pipelines</strong>, ensuring rapid, continuous integration and deployment of machine learning models.</li>
												<li><strong>Sentiment Analysis & Likelihood of Escalation:</strong> These projects involved building models to analyze customer sentiment and predict the likelihood of escalation, helping businesses proactively address customer issues and improve customer satisfaction.</li>
												<li><strong>Prompt Tuning for LLM Features:</strong> I worked on optimizing and fine-tuning prompts for <strong>large language models (LLMs)</strong> to improve conversational AI features, providing more accurate and context-aware responses.</li>
												<li><strong>Similar Tickets Identification:</strong> I contributed to creating a system for identifying and clustering <strong>similar customer tickets</strong>, streamlining ticket management and reducing redundancy.</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
									</ul>
									
									<p>My experience at Freshworks has not only honed my technical expertise but also fostered a passion for solving complex problems with innovative machine learning solutions.</p>
